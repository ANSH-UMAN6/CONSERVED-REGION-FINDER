Understanding the conservation of certain regions within proteins across different species or variants is crucial for elucidating their biological functions, evolutionary relationships, and potential binding sites. Various computational tools and algorithms have been developed to identify conserved regions within protein sequences. This study introduces an innovative web application tailored for identifying conserved regions within protein sequences. The application provides an intuitive interface, enabling users to conduct sequence conservation analysis without necessitating specialized bioinformatics expertise. Utilizing Python's Flask framework and the Biopython library, the application empowers users to upload FASTA files containing multiple protein sequences. Upon upload, the server-side script meticulously compares each protein sequence to a reference sequence, discerning conserved regions. The results are meticulously presented, delineating the processed proteins, the identified conserved regions, and their precise locations within each protein. The application offers a seamless interface for biologists and bioinformaticians to analyze evolutionary conservation patterns across multiple proteins. The application provides a valuable tool for researchers and biologists to quickly analyze their sequence data and identify conserved regions of interest. web-based nature of the application makes it accessible from any device with internet access, enhancing its usability and convenience. Understanding conserved regions within protein sequences is crucial for elucidating their functional significance and evolutionary relationships. This tool facilitates the identification and visualization of such regions, aiding researchers in deciphering the molecular basis of biological processes. The application begins by prompting users to upload a FASTA file containing protein sequences through a user-friendly web interface. Upon submission, the server-side script parses the file, extracting individual sequences for analysis. The first sequence in the file serves as the reference sequence against which subsequent sequences are compared. This web-based tool offers a valuable resource for researchers engaged in protein sequence analysis and comparative genomics. By providing insights into conserved regions across multiple proteins, it enhances our understanding of protein structure, function, and evolutionary conservation. Future enhancements could include additional visualization features and integration with external databases for comprehensive sequence annotation and analysis
